WO Holdings: Patent Application for Work Organized (W-O) Model Architecture
Utility Patent Application
Title: Work Organized (W-O) Model for Text Extraction and Correction from Images

Inventor: João Rocha

Assignee: WO Holdings

Field of the Invention:
The present invention relates to the field of image processing, specifically to methods and systems for extracting and correcting text from images using advanced deep learning techniques.

Background of the Invention:
Traditional OCR systems struggle with accuracy in complex images. The W-O model integrates CNNs, R-CNNs, deep-float correction, and LLM refinement to enhance text extraction and correction.

Summary of the Invention:
The W-O model includes:

Image processing using CNNs to extract feature vectors.
Text detection via OCR models.
Bounding box extraction using R-CNN.
Positional embeddings from bounding boxes.
Text correction using deep-float models.
Text refinement using LLMs such as PHY3.

Figure 6: LLM-based text refinement.
Detailed Description of the Invention:
The W-O model processes an image through a CNN to extract feature vectors. OCR detects text regions, and R-CNN extracts bounding boxes. Positional embeddings are calculated from these boxes, and deep-float models correct the detected text. Finally, an LLM refines the text for contextual accuracy.

Claims:

A system for extracting and correcting text from images, comprising:
A CNN for feature extraction.
An OCR model for text detection.
An R-CNN for bounding box extraction.
A method for calculating positional embeddings.
A deep-float model for text correction.
An LLM for text refinement.
